# Module 4: PyCitySchool Analysis

# *Overview*:
The initial purpose of this analysis was an evaluation of student test scores and funding data to assist the school and district in strategic decision making.  Upon completion of that analysis, it was requested that I remove the 9th grade math and reading scores for Thomas High School (THS) and re-run the  analysis based on this new data.

# *Results*: 
## [Impact to District Summary](https://github.com/laurlen2112/School_District_Analysis/blob/main/resources/district_summary_comparison.png): 
*	461 students from THS were removed from the analysis, reducing the total student count to 38,709
*	No change to the total budget
*	Comparison of the [unformatted District Summary](https://github.com/laurlen2112/School_District_Analysis/blob/main/resources/district_summary_comparison_unformatted.png)  shows a small drop in average grades and percent of passing students:
    *	estimated 0.05 drop in average math scores
    *	estimated 0.22% drop in students passing math
    *	estimated 0.02 drop in average reading scores
    *	estimated 0.14% drop in students passing reading
*	Drop in the overall passing percentage is estimated at 0.32%
